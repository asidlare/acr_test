Question #1: Find number of devices that have more than 10 backups.
(There is no enough data in the table to have a result but the query can be the following.)
'''
WITH devices AS (
    SELECT
        device_name,
        count(*) as cnt
    FROM Backups
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
    count(*)
FROM devices
WHERE
    cnt > 10
'''

Question #2: Find number of devices that have only full backups.
(There is no device in a table with full backups only but the following query will work.)
'''
WITH devices AS (
    SELECT
        device_name,
        ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT backup_type) AS backup_types
    FROM Backups
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
    count(*)
FROM devices
WHERE
    backup_types &> ARRAY['Full']
    AND ARRAY_LENGTH(backup_type, 1) = 1
'''

Question #3: Find average size of last full backups among all devices that have full backups.
(I added round to have better representation.)
'''
WITH devices AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        device_name,
        LAST_VALUE(backup_size) OVER (
            PARTITION BY device_name
            ORDER BY backup_date
            RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
        ) AS last_backup_size
    FROM Backups
    WHERE
        backup_type = 'Full'
)
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(last_backup_size), 2)
FROM devices
